AncientGreymon is an Ancient Dragon Digimon whose name and design are derived from "Ancient" and "Greymon". 
Possessing the attribute of "Flame", it is one of the Ten Legendary Warriors that saved the ancient Digital World. 
A Mega who existed only in the distant past, it is told that its strength surpasses that of current Megas, and it is certainly a "Mega" being. 
Its abilities were later passed on to the "Dragon Digimon" of the Greymon-species. 
It is said that in the previous crusade, it survived to the end alongside AncientGarurumon, and sealed away Lucemon.
